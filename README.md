# [DevOps Academy V1] Project 1: Docekr + CI/CD

In this project I deploy a pre-build "Hello World" web app using Docer and automate its build and deployment process with a CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions.

## Project Goal 

Showcase core DevOps skills in containerization (Docker) and automation (CI/CD), aligning with the DevOps Academy learning objectives.

## Quick Start (placeholder)

* Build and Run Locally: (to be added D2)
* CI Status: (to be added D11)

## CI Pipeline Plan

1. **Lint:** Validate the Dockerfile for syntax errors and best practicies.
2. **Build:** Build the Docker image.
3. **Push:** Push the image to GitHub Container Registry.

## Why This Project

A direct match with the DevOps Academy fundamentals - providing me with the oportunity demonstrate my abilithy to:

* Conteinarize applications with **Docer**
* Automate builds using **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
* Manage version controle with **Git**


## IBM Course References 

This projcet allowes me to apply concepts from the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate, including:

* **Getting Started with Git and GitHub** -> Repository setup and version control

* **Introduction to Containers with Docker** -> Writing and optimizing Dockerfiles 

* **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** -> Pipeline automation
